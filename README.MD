# 100 Days of Machine Learning

Welcome to the **100 Days of Machine Learning** challenge! This repository will guide you through 100 days of hands-on projects and exercises to master the fundamentals of machine learning. Each day will feature a new concept, tutorial, or project focused on building your skills in data science and machine learning.

### What to Expect:
- **Daily Lessons**: Each day focuses on a different machine learning concept or practice.
- **Hands-on Projects**: Start coding immediately and work on real-world datasets.
- **Progressive Learning**: Concepts build on each other, starting with basics and advancing to deep learning and other specialized areas.

## Day 1: Introduction to Data Preprocessing

In this section, we will cover the essential steps of data preprocessing, which is a critical part of any machine learning pipeline. On Day 1, we will focus on the Titanic dataset to perform some basic preprocessing tasks, including:

- Loading the dataset
- Exploring and analyzing the dataset
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features

These steps will set the stage for working with machine learning models in later days.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   EDA involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, often with visual methods. It helps in understanding the structure of the data, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies.
   - **Resources**:
     - [Pandas DataFrame Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)
     - [Matplotlib (for visualization)](https://matplotlib.org/)
   
2. **Data Cleaning and Imputation**:
   - **Missing Values**: Missing data can negatively affect machine learning models. We can handle missing values by either removing rows with missing data or imputing them with estimated values (such as the median, mean, or mode).
   - **Imputation Strategy**: Imputation is a technique where missing values are replaced with estimated values based on other data points in the dataset.
     - **Resources**:
       - [Scikit-learn SimpleImputer Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.impute.SimpleImputer.html)
       - [Pandas isnull() and fillna()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.isnull.html)

3. **Categorical Encoding**:
   - **One-Hot Encoding**: Categorical data (e.g., gender, city, etc.) needs to be converted into a numerical format before it can be used by machine learning algorithms. One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category in a variable.
   - **Label Encoding**: Label encoding is another method where each category is assigned a unique integer. Itâ€™s typically used for ordinal categorical data (e.g., "low", "medium", "high").
     - **Resources**:
       - [Scikit-learn OneHotEncoder Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html)
       - [Scikit-learn LabelEncoder Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html)

4. **Feature Scaling**:
   - **Min-Max Scaling**: This technique scales numerical features to a range between 0 and 1. It is crucial when algorithms that rely on distance calculations (like KNN or neural networks) are used.
     - **Resources**:
       - [Scikit-learn MinMaxScaler Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html)

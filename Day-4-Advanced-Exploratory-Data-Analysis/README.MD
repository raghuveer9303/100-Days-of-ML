## Day 4: Advanced Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering with the Boston Housing Dataset

On Day 4, we explored advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and feature engineering using the Boston Housing dataset. The goal was to investigate data quality, detect outliers, perform dimensionality reduction, and generate time-series features for deeper insights.

This advanced session introduced practical applications of techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Lasso regression for feature selection, and synthetic time-series analysis.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Dataset Overview and Structure Investigation**:
   - Analyze numerical and categorical features using `pandas` for a clear understanding of data types.
   - Check for missing values and understand data integrity.
   - **Resources**:
     - [Pandas DataFrame info()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.info.html)
     - [Pandas select_dtypes()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.select_dtypes.html)

2. **Outlier Detection and Visualization**:
   - **Interquartile Range (IQR)**:
     - Detects outliers by measuring the range between the 25th (Q1) and 75th (Q3) percentiles.
     - Outliers are data points outside 1.5 Ã— IQR from Q1 or Q3.
   - **Boxplots**:
     - Visualize outliers across multiple numerical features.
   - **Standard Deviation Method**:
     - Identifies and treats outliers using the 3-sigma rule
     - Data points beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean are capped
   - **Visualization**:
     - Boxplots before and after outlier treatment to assess the impact
     - Uses seaborn for clear visual comparison
   - **Resources**:
     - [Pandas quantile()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.quantile.html)
     - [Seaborn boxplot Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html)

3. **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**:
   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
     - Reduces high-dimensional data into fewer components while retaining maximum variance.
     - Useful for visualizing complex datasets and eliminating redundant features.
     - Example: Explained variance ratio of principal components.
   - **Lasso Regression**:
     - Regularization method that shrinks coefficients of less important features to zero, effectively selecting only the most relevant features.
     - Lasso helps in understanding feature importance through coefficient visualization.
   - **Resources**:
     - [Scikit-learn PCA Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)
     - [Scikit-learn LassoCV Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV.html)

4. **Time-Series Feature Engineering**:
   - **Synthetic Time-Series Generation**:
     - Created synthetic time-series data to demonstrate time-based trends and variability.
   - **Seasonal Decomposition**:
     - Used `statsmodels` to decompose time-series data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
   - **Resources**:
     - [Datetime Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
     - [Statsmodels Seasonal Decompose](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose.html)

### Summary of Insights:

1. **Data Quality**:
   - No missing values in the dataset.
   - Numerical features dominate the dataset structure.

2. **Outlier Analysis**:
   - Several numerical features exhibited significant outliers, visualized effectively using boxplots.
   - Outlier treatment may be necessary before building predictive models.

3. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - PCA captured the majority of variance in the first two components, enabling visualization of the dataset in 2D.
   - Lasso regression highlighted the most predictive features for house prices, reducing the complexity of the dataset.

4. **Time-Series Analysis**:
   - Seasonal decomposition illustrated trends and seasonality within the synthetic time-series data, showcasing potential for forecasting applications.

### Visualizations:
- **Boxplots**: Illustrated outliers across multiple features.
- **PCA Scatterplot**: Showcased data distribution along two principal components, color-coded by target variable (`MEDV`).
- **Lasso Coefficients**: Highlighted the importance of features in predicting house prices.
- **Time-Series Plots**: Demonstrated synthetic trends and variability over time.
- **Seasonal Decomposition Plots**: Provided a breakdown of time-series components.

### Next Steps:
- Integrate advanced feature selection techniques (e.g., Lasso-selected features) into predictive models.
- Apply robust methods for handling outliers and scaling numerical features.
- Extend time-series analysis for real-world applications like demand forecasting or trend analysis.
